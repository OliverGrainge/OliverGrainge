## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Oliver Grainge**, a researcher and engineer passionate about **machine intelligence**, **computer vision** and **NLP**.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Developing efficient **low-bit quantized neural networks** for resource-constrained devices.
- **Binary** and **Ternary** Quantization techniques for Transformer Networks
- **Pruning** methods for neural network compression

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Advanced **neural network compression** techniques.
- Exploring **large-scale language models** for generative AI.

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- **Open-source AI projects** related to computer vision and neural network optimization.
- **Research collaborations** focused on AI applications in embedded systems.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- Efficient AI architectures (quantized networks, model pruning).
- Robotics and **ROS-based** navigation systems.
- Training neural networks using **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.

### ðŸ“« How to reach me:
- Email: [oliver@grainge.me](mailto:oliver@grainge.me)
- LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/oliver-grainge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-grainge-a6b45a132/)

### âš¡ Fun fact:
When I'm not diving into AI research, you can find me exploring the intersection of **robotics** and **architecture** or fine-tuning neural networks on the edge!
