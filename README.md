## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm **Oliver Grainge**, a researcher and engineer passionate about **machine intelligence**, **computer vision**, and **AI for embedded systems**.

### ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Developing efficient **low-bit quantized neural networks** for resource-constrained devices.
- Improving **visual place recognition** using structured pruning techniques.

### ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Advanced **neural network compression** techniques.
- Exploring **large-scale language models** for generative AI.

### ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- **Open-source AI projects** related to computer vision and neural network optimization.
- **Research collaborations** focused on AI applications in embedded systems.

### ğŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- Efficient AI architectures (quantized networks, model pruning).
- Robotics and **ROS-based** navigation systems.
- Training neural networks using **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.

### ğŸ“« How to reach me:
